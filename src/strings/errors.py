Function and variable definitions used for validation rules and error messages.

Funcs:
- incorrect_type(type_lookup, *args): 

This function takes a dictionary 'type_lookup' and two arguments, 
and it returns a formatted string describing an incorrect instance
type being provided to a specific attribute. It also indicates the
expected type for that attribute based on the 'type_lookup' dictionary.

Vars:
- username_length:  A string describing the validation rule for usernames, 
                    stating that they must be no more than 50 characters.

- password_length:  A string describing the validation rule for passwords,
                    indicating that they must be at least 8 characters.

- invalid_username: A string describing the validation rule for usernames, 
                    specifying that they can only contain alphanumeric 
                    characters, underscores, and hyphens.

- invalid_password: A string describing the validation rule for passwords, 
                    stating that they must contain at least one uppercase 
                    letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one symbol.
